## Overview
This folder contains several useful Python scripts designed to aid in the visualization and robustness testing of 3D part segmentation and classification models.

### Files Description

1. **`visualize.py`**
   - This script is used for visualizing 3D part segmentation problems of objects using **2024 points**.
   - It helps to understand how well the model segments the parts of an object during inference.
   - **Usage**: Ensure you load the saved model after training to visualize the results.

2. **`visualizeFullCAD.py`**
   - This script visualizes 3D part segmentation of objects in the **test set** using **all available points**.
   - It provides a complete view of the object segmentation by not restricting the visualization to a subset of points.
   - **Usage**: As with `visualize.py`, make sure to load the saved model after training to visualize the objectâ€™s segmentation.

3. **`robustness.py`**
   - This script tests the **robustness** of the model specifically for the **classification problem**.
   - You can drop the number of points during testing (modify the value of `N2` in the code) to assess how the model performs when fewer points are available.
   - **Usage**: Use this script to evaluate how the model behaves when objects have incomplete or reduced point sets.

### Loading the Model
For both `visualize.py` and `visualizeFullCAD.py`, ensure that the model trained on the dataset is loaded before running the scripts. This will allow proper visualization of the 3D part segmentation results.

### Robustness Testing
In `robustness.py`, you can experiment with different values of `N2` to simulate a scenario where the number of points per object is reduced, and test how robust the classification model is under such conditions.

## Requirements
- Ensure that you have all necessary dependencies installed for running the scripts, including but not limited to:
  - PyTorch
  - Matplotlib
  - Numpy
  - Any other required packages specific to your trained model setup

## Usage
- For 3D part segmentation visualizations:
  ```bash
  python visualize.py
